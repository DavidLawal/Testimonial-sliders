                    <p>I think this platform is great overall, the only real issue i've been
                        dealing with is that after watching a reel or somtimes just a regular
                        video, the feed resets when exited and i cycle through a lot of the same 
                        posts.

                    <p>So far, it has been excellent. However, sometimes when you click to 
                        double your points and it goes to an ad? It seems to get stuck, like it
                        won't let you return to the game after the ad's timer has run out.

                    <p>For how big this platform is, I'm super impressed with how quick it
                        functions regardless if i'm on data or Wifi. Yes, it builds up a sizable
                        cache in a short amount of time, but that's an easy fix in the settings.

                    <p>Great Platform! but one annoying bug involving the friend tab: sometimes
                        when i see a notification for a new friend, no new friend will show up in my 
                        feed, or the notification disappears after a few seconds

                    <p>The only platform on my phone that launchess multiple instances of itself.
                        can quickly become resource-consuming when using the app throughout the day.
                        Most recommended platform in the world.
